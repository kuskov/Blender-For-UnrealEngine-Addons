# Prepare asset(s) to export
We will see how to prepare the assets to export.

1. Open Tool panel in 3D View (T), enlarge it, open Unreal engine 4 main panel and go in Object Properties panel.
<img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocScreen1.jpg">

2. Select the asset you want to export and set the Export type property to "Export recursive". Now repeat the task for all the objects you want to export:
	- Each objects having this property will export with all its children in a Fbx file. If you don't want to export the child set "Not exported" for Export type in Object Properties of the child, else keep "Auto".
	- The center of the scene of the Fbx file will be equal to the origin point location of the object in blender. The position of the object in the Blender scene does not matter.
	- For the Skeletal mesh you need to set the Export type for Armature as Export recursive.

# Import properties
It is possible to define parameters for importing your assets in Unreal Engine in the Object Import Properties panel. This works only with importing via UnrealEnginePython.
About UnrealEnginePython: https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython </br>
How to import assets in Unreal Engine [Doc](https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/How%20import%20assets%20from%20Blender%20to%20Unreal.md)


# Collisions and Sockets
It possible to create collisions (StaticMesh) and sockets (Static/SkeletalMesh) for your Assets directly in blender.

1. Create a new mesh, it will be your collider shape (For a socket create a Empty object). 
	- An asset can contain multiple collider shapes but each collider must use a different object.
2. Select your collider Shape(s) or Empty(s) and at the end select the owner object.
	- For the SkeletalMesh select the Empty(s) then the owner bone in PoseMode.
3. Open Collisions and Sockets panel and click on the appropriate button to convert the selection to either collider or socket (Converted collider are green are now the child of the asset). 
	- About StaticMeshes collision:	https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Content/FBX/StaticMeshes#collision.
	- If you want to create a capsule use 2 sphere in a same object. <img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocCollisionCapsule.gif">
	- If a  "Not exported" child contains collider, the collider will not be exported as the child.
	- If you change the name of the object that contains the collider you will need to click on Check potential errors button to update hierarchy name of all the colliders.

# Level of details
This works only on StaticMesh with importing via UnrealEnginePython.
1. Select the asset you want to export and set the Export type property to "Export recursive". 
2. Now repeat the task for all LODs but also check the box "Export as lod?".
3. Select your main asset and open the panel Object Import Properties.
4. Set LOD1, LOD2, [...] to your desired LODs.

# Animations
It is of course possible to export animations with your skeletal. You can use the Action Editor in Dope Sheet windows to have multiple animations in one scene or use the NonLinearAnimation.

For the Action:
1. Select your SkeletalMesh and open Animation Properties panel (Do not forget to set the Armature as Export recursive).
2. Inside Dope Sheet windows set Action Editor mode and create your animations on actions ( /!\ Don't forget to use fake user to not lose your animation ! )
	- You can use driver for the Morph Target.
<img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocAction.jpg"> 
3. In Animation panel Properties you can set the animations property of your skeletal mesh like Animation time, Quality, and select the animations to export.

For the NLA:
1. Select your SkeletalMesh and open Animation Properties panel (Do not forget to set the Armature as "Export recursive")
2. In Animation panel Properties you can set the animations property of your skeletal mesh like Animation time, Quality.
3. If you just want the NLAnimation set Action to export as Not exported and check the box Export Nla with your desired name.

# Export animation with Proxys
If you want export the animations of a Skeletal Mesh with Proxys you should set proxy as parent of you collection and set Export recursive on the proxy.

<img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocActionWithProxy.jpg"> 

Warning: don't use the exported fbx from a proxy like a Skeleton or SkeletalMesh. It containt a double Rig.

# Alembic animation
Alembic export and import can take a lot of time.
1. Select the asset you want to export (Armature with child or Mesh).
2. Set the Export type property to "Export recursive".
3. Check the box Export as "Alembic animation".
4. Don't forget to check the box Alembic animation(s) in Asset types to export. Make sure that the animation was played at least once for bake cache. You can also use the command "bpy.ops.ptcache.bake_all()" to bake the physics.

# Change export transform
You can set specific transform options at export in Avanced object properties panel. Example video: https://youtu.be/rbW5NcyNoK0


# Marterial
Materials are not imported, you must create them in Unreal Engine.
1. Create your material in Unreal Engine .
2. Create a basic material in Blender with the same name.
3. If you use the import script set the Material Search Location with your desired search location.
4. If you don't use the import script, you need to set the Material > Search Location in Unreal with your desired location when you import.

# Armature and Skeleton Tree
You can set the name what the amature should use once exported in Addon Preferences.
If the name used is "Armature" Unreal Engine will remove the root bone but the animation will be 100 times smaller. (This is produced because the first bone will always be a size of 100 in Skeleton but not in Animation.)

# Nomenclature 
The nomenclature is by default defined in correlation with the Unreal Engine Pipeline but you can change it if you use another pipeline.
By default the all assets are exported to the location of the blender(.blend) which can be changed if you want. 
Depending on the assets you can also set a sub folder in Object Properties panel > Sub folder.
The nomenclature also contains the name of the script and additional file.

# Export process
Now we can export all asset.

1. Open the Export panel.
	- You can choose the type of object to export.
2. Click on Check potential errors button.
	- This will update all hierarchy name, correct the bad properties and show the potential errors.
<img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocPotentialErrors.jpg">
3. Now click on the Export for UnrealEngine 4 button.
	- Animations, Poses and cameras can take a long time to export.
	- See in blender system console for more info.
	- At each new export the old files will be overwritten.
<img src="https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons/blob/master/Tuto/ExportAssetDocConsoleLog.jpg">
4. The files are placed by default at the location of the blender(.blend) file in folder ExportedFbx.
